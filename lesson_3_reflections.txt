When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  If you want to work with other people on the same project, make it open
  source or work on it with another computer, you would want to use a remote
  repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because sometimes another user is working on the same code. So if he would
  change something that would affect your code and is pulled directly from
  the remote, your code gets confusing or even unreadable.
