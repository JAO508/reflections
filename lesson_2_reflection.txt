What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialize a repository you create a new repository which can be
  reached by other computers. So to exchange data or files with git you have
  to initialize a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The working directory is the place, where the files are created
  and worked on.The staging area is the transport station for the file to
  transport it to the repository. It offers the possibility to on file and just
  commit it to the repository when it is ready for it.
